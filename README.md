# CloneToolX for macOS
Disk cloning software for macOS Big Sur 11.5.2+
ClonetoolX has officially reached Beta stage.

On a supported Mac this now works on macOS 11.5.2. 
While the command line is not hard, CloneToolX with its GUI makes things way more simple.

##### Note: The current version does not support a helper agent for running as admin or root
There are two workarounds for this. Open in Xcode. Go to Edit Scheme. Make sure it is set to root. Then run from Xode
The second workaround, `sudo .../CloneToolX.app/Contents/MacOS/CloneToolX`

Hope to add a helper agent soon.
